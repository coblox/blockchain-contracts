[COMIT](https://comit.network) is an open protocol facilitating cross-blockchain applications.
For example, with [COMIT](https://comit.network) you can exchange Bitcoin for Ether or any ERC20 token directly with another person.

This repository contains the the assembly/script code of blockchain contracts used in the COMIT protocol.

If you wish to do an atomic swap on your machine or to integrate COMIT into an application (e.g. a DEX) please take a look at the [Getting Started section](https://comit.network/docs/getting-started/create-comit-app/) of the COMIT documentation.
